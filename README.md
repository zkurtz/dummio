# dummio

IO for dummies! A unified `save`/`load` interface using the most common and recommendable default options for IO between various object types and file types. For example, instead of
```
with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    data = json.load(file)
```
you can simply
```
data = dummio.json.load(file_path)
```

Users may pass additional keyword arguments to the underlying IO methods.


## Direct IO vs cloud paths

Most dummio IO calls "just work" against cloud paths like `s3://bucket/key`, `gs://bucket/key`, or `az://container/key`. For example, `dummio.json.load("s3://bucket/key")` will read a json file from an S3 bucket. Notes:
- Shout-out: [universal-pathlib](https://github.com/fsspec/universal_pathlib) powers much of the cloud-iteroperability on our backend.
- Warning: Although we manually run `demo/cloud.py` to ensure basic functionality, current CI unit testing does not cover cloud interactions.

## Standardized IO interface

In some coding applications it is desirable to pass an IO module as an argument to a function. Here it is convenient to pass a dummio submodule, since all dummio submodules have the same `save` and `load` interface, having equivalent signatures (except for differences hidden in `**kwargs`).

## Supported object and file types

So far we support:
- text, pickle, and dill
- simple dictionaries:
    - json
    - yaml
- pandas dataframes:
    - csv
    - feather
    - parquet
- onnx.ModelProto instances
- pydantic models (relying on the built-in json serialization methods)

Filepaths passed to `save` and `load` methods can be of type `str`, `pathlib.Path`, or `universal_pathlib.UPath`.

## Dependencies

[universal-pathlib](https://github.com/fsspec/universal_pathlib) is our only required dependency.

For other dependencies, such as pandas, calling `from dummio.pandas import df_parquet` will raise a helpful message to install pandas if you have not already done so.

## Examples

Basic IO methods can be accessed directly as `dummio.text`, `dummio.json`, etc:.
```
import dummio

text = "hello world"
data = {"key": text}
path = "io_example_file"

# Text
dummio.text.save(text, path=path)
assert text == dummio.text.load(path)

# YAML
dummio.yaml.save(data)
assert data == dummio.yaml.load(path)
```

See `demo/cloud.py` for more many other examples.

## Installation

We're [on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dummio/), so `pip install dummio`.
